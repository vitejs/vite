# Vite Maintenance Principles

Vite aims to be lightweight, and this includes being aware of the number of npm dependencies and their size.

We use rollup to pre-bundle most dependencies before publishing! Therefore most dependencies, even used in src code, should be added under `devDependencies` by default. This also creates a number of constraints that we need to be aware of in the codebase:

## Usage of `require()`

In some cases we intentionally lazy-require some dependencies to improve startup performance. However, note that we cannot use simple `require('somedep')` calls since these are ignored in ESM files so the dependency won't be included in the bundle, and the actual dependency won't even be there when published since they are in `devDependencies`.

Instead, use `(await import('somedep')).default`.

## Think before adding a dependency

Most deps should be added to `devDependencies` even if they are needed at runtime. Some exceptions are:

- Type packages. Example: `@types/*`.
- Deps that cannot be properly bundled due to binary files. Example: `esbuild`.
- Deps that ships its own types and its type is used in vite's own public types. Example: `rollup`.

Avoid deps that has large transitive dependencies that results in bloated size compared to the functionality it provides. For example, `http-proxy` itself plus `@types/http-proxy` is a little over 1MB in size, but `http-proxy-middleware` pulls in a ton of dependencies that makes it 7MB(!) when a minimal custom middleware on top of `http-proxy` only requires a couple lines of code.

## Ensure type support

Vite aims to be fully usable as a dependency in a TypeScript project (e.g. it should provide proper typings for VitePress), and also in `vite.config.ts`. This means technically a dependency whose types are exposed needs to be part of `dependencies` instead of `devDependencies`. However, these means we won't be able to bundle it.

To get around this, we inline some of these dependencies' types in `packages/vite/types`. This way we can still expose the typing but bundle the dependency's source code.

## Think before adding yet another option

We already have many config options, and we should avoid fixing an issue by adding yet another one. Before adding an option, try to think about:

- Whether the problem is really worth addressing
- Whether the problem can be fixed with a smarter default
- Whether the problem has workaround using existing options
- Whether the problem can be addressed with a plugin instead
