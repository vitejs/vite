# Plugins

:::tip NOTE
Vite aims to provide out-of-the-box support for common web development patterns. Before searching for a Vite or Compatible Rollup plugin, check out the [Features Guide](../guide/features.md). A lot of the cases where a plugin would be needed in a Rollup project are already covered in Vite.

Check out [Using Plugins](../guide/using-plugins) for information on how to use plugins.

## Official Plugins

### [@vitejs/plugin-vue](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-vue/tree/main/packages/plugin-vue)

Provides Vue 3 Single File Components support.

### [@vitejs/plugin-vue-jsx](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-vue/tree/main/packages/plugin-vue-jsx)

Provides Vue 3 JSX support (via [dedicated Babel transform](https://github.com/vuejs/babel-plugin-jsx)).

### [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/tree/main/packages/plugin-react)

Uses esbuild and Babel, achieving fast HMR with a small package footprint and the flexibility of being able to use the Babel transform pipeline. Without additional Babel plugins, only esbuild is used during builds.

### [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/tree/main/packages/plugin-react-swc)

Replaces Babel with SWC during development. During production builds, SWC+esbuild are used when using plugins, and esbuild only otherwise. For big projects that don't require non-standard React extensions, cold start and Hot Module Replacement (HMR) can be significantly faster.

### [@vitejs/plugin-legacy](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/plugin-legacy)

Provides legacy browsers support for the production build.
