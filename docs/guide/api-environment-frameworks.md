# Environment API for Frameworks

:::warning Experimental
Initial work for this API was introduced in Vite 5.1 with the name "Vite Runtime API". This guide describes a revised API, renamed to Environment API. This API will be released in Vite 6 as experimental. You can already test it in the latest `vite@6.0.0-beta.x` version.

Resources:

- [Feedback discussion](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/discussions/16358) where we are gathering feedback about the new APIs.
- [Environment API PR](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/16471) where the new API were implemented and reviewed.

Please share with us your feedback as you test the proposal.

## Environments and frameworks

The available environments in a dev server can be accessed using `server.environments`:

```js
const environment = server.environments.client

environment.transformRequest(url)

console.log(server.environments.ssr.moduleGraph)
```

A dev environment is an instance of the `DevEnvironment` class:

```ts
class DevEnvironment {
  /**
   * Unique identifier for the environment in a Vite server.
   * By default Vite exposes 'client' and 'ssr' environments.
   */
  name: string
  /**
   * Communication channel to send and receive messages from the
   * associated module runner in the target runtime.
   */
  hot: HotChannel | null
  /**
   * Graph of module nodes, with the imported relationship between
   * processed modules and the cached result of the processed code.
   */
  moduleGraph: EnvironmentModuleGraph
  /**
   * Resolved plugins for this environment, including the ones
   * created using the per-environment `create` hook
   */
  plugins: Plugin[]
  /**
   * Allows to resolve, load, and transform code through the
   * environment plugins pipeline
   */
  pluginContainer: EnvironmentPluginContainer
  /**
   * Resolved config options for this environment. Options at the server
   * global scope are taken as defaults for all environments, and can
   * be overridden (resolve conditions, external, optimizedDeps)
   */
  config: ResolvedConfig & ResolvedDevEnvironmentOptions

  constructor(name, config, { hot, options }: DevEnvironmentSetup)

  /**
   * Resolve the URL to an id, load it, and process the code using the
   * plugins pipeline. The module graph is also updated.
   */
  async transformRequest(url: string): TransformResult

  /**
   * Register a request to be processed with low priority. This is useful
   * to avoid waterfalls. The Vite server has information about the imported
   * modules by other requests, so it can warmup the module graph so the
   * modules are already processed when they are requested.
   */
  async warmupRequest(url: string): void
}
```

With `TransformResult` being:

```ts
interface TransformResult {
  code: string
  map: SourceMap | { mappings: '' } | null
  etag?: string
  deps?: string[]
  dynamicDeps?: string[]
}
```

:::warning
The `runner` is evaluated eagerly when it's accessed for the first time. Beware that Vite enables source map support when the `runner` is created by calling `process.setSourceMapsEnabled` or by overriding `Error.prepareStackTrace` if it's not available.
:::

An environment instance in the Vite server lets you process a URL using the `environment.transformRequest(url)` method. This function will use the plugin pipeline to resolve the `url` to a module `id`, load it (reading the file from the file system or through a plugin that implements a virtual module), and then transform the code. While transforming the module, imports and other metadata will be recorded in the environment module graph by creating or updating the corresponding module node. When processing is done, the transform result is also stored in the module.

But the environment instance can't execute the code itself, as the runtime where the module will be run could be different from the one the Vite server is running in. This is the case for the browser environment. When a html is loaded in the browser, its scripts are executed triggering the evaluation of the entire static module graph. Each imported URL generates a request to the Vite server to get the module code, which ends up handled by the Transform Middleware by calling `server.environments.client.transformRequest(url)`. The connection between the environment instance in the server and the module runner in the browser is carried out through HTTP in this case.

:::info transformRequest naming
We are using `transformRequest(url)` and `warmupRequest(url)` in the current version of this proposal so it is easier to discuss and understand for users used to Vite's current API. Before releasing, we can take the opportunity to review these names too. For example, it could be named `environment.processModule(url)` or `environment.loadModule(url)` taking a page from Rollup's `context.load(id)` in plugin hooks. For the moment, we think keeping the current names and delaying this discussion is better.
:::

Vite also exposes a `RunnableDevEnvironment`. While this is only implementable for some runtimes as it requires the runtime to be the same with the one the Vite server is running in, this works similarly with `ssrLoadModule`. You can guard any runnable environment with an `isRunnableDevEnvironment` function.
In dev mode the default `ssr` environment is a `RunnableDevEnvironment`.

```ts
export class RunnableDevEnvironment extends DevEnvironment {
  public readonly runner: ModuleRunnner
}

class ModuleRunner {
  /**
   * URL to execute. Accepts file path, server path, or id relative to the root.
   * Returns an instantiated module (same as in ssrLoadModule)
   */
  public async import(url: string): Promise<Record<string, any>>
  /**
   * Other ModuleRunner methods...
   */
}

if (isRunnableDevEnvironment(server.environments.ssr)) {
  await server.environments.ssr.runner.import('/entry-point.js')
}
```

:::info
In the v5.1 Runtime API, there were `executeUrl` and `executeEntryPoint` methods - they are now merged into a single `import` method. If you want to opt-out of the HMR support, create a runner with `hmr: false` flag.
:::

## Using custom environments

A Vite dev server exposes two environments by default: a `client` environment and an `ssr` environment. The client environment is a browser environment by default and the SSR environment runs in the same Node runtime as the Vite server by default.

To register a custom environment (for example to have a separate module graph for [RSC](https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/22/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-march-2023#react-server-components)), you can pass a new property to the `environments` option. You can also use a plugin (See [Environment API for Plugins](./api-environment-plugins.md#registering-new-environments-using-hooks)).

```ts
import { createServer, createRunnableDevEnvironment } from 'vite'

const server = await createServer({
  /* ... */
  environments: {
    rsc: {
      dev: {
        createEnvironment(name, config) {
          return createRunnableDevEnvironment(name, config)
        },
      },
      build: {
        outDir: '/dist/rsc',
      },
    },
  },
})

// TODO: Maybe we should expose a `createNodeEnvironment` function (an environment factory for Node)?
```

Then, you can access the environment from `server.environments[environmentName]` (e.g. `server.environments.rsc`) as usual.

## Using `RunnableDevEnvironment`

Given a Vite server configured in middleware mode as described by the [SSR setup guide](/guide/ssr#setting-up-the-dev-server), let's implement the SSR middleware using the environment API. Error handling is omitted.

```js
import { createServer, createRunnableDevEnvironment } from 'vite'

const server = await createServer({
  server: { middlewareMode: true },
  appType: 'custom',
  environments: {
    node: {
      dev: {
        // Default Vite SSR environment can be overridden in the config, so
        // make sure you have a Node environment before the request is received.
        createEnvironment(name, config) {
          return createRunnableDevEnvironment(name, config)
        },
      },
    },
  },
})

// You might need to cast this to RunnableDevEnvironment in TypeScript or use
// the "isRunnableDevEnvironment" function to guard the access to the runner
const environment = server.environments.node

app.use('*', async (req, res, next) => {
  const url = req.originalUrl

  // 1. Read index.html
  let template = fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, 'index.html'), 'utf-8')

  // 2. Apply Vite HTML transforms. This injects the Vite HMR client,
  //    and also applies HTML transforms from Vite plugins, e.g. global
  //    preambles from @vitejs/plugin-react
  template = await server.transformIndexHtml(url, template)

  // 3. Load the server entry. import(url) automatically transforms
  //    ESM source code to be usable in Node.js! There is no bundling
  //    required, and provides full HMR support.
  const { render } = await environment.runner.import('/src/entry-server.js')

  // 4. render the app HTML. This assumes entry-server.js's exported
  //     `render` function calls appropriate framework SSR APIs,
  //    e.g. ReactDOMServer.renderToString()
  const appHtml = await render(url)

  // 5. Inject the app-rendered HTML into the template.
  const html = template.replace(`<!--ssr-outlet-->`, appHtml)

  // 6. Send the rendered HTML back.
  res.status(200).set({ 'Content-Type': 'text/html' }).end(html)
})
```

::: warning Accessing Module on the Server
We do not want to encourage communication between the server and the runner. One of the problems that was exposed with `vite.ssrLoadModule` is over-reliance on the server state inside the processed modules. This makes it harder to implement runtime-agnostic SSR since user environment might have no access to server APIs. For example, this code assumes that Vite server and user code can run in the same context:

```ts
const vite = createServer()
const routes = collectRoutes()

const { processRoutes } = await vite.ssrLoadModule('internal:routes-processor')
processRoutes(routes)
```

This makes it impossible to run user code in the same way it might run in production (for example, on the edge) because the server state and user state are coupled. So instead, we recommend using virtual modules to import the state and process it inside the user module:

```ts
// this code runs on another machine or in another thread

import { runner } from './ssr-module-runner.js'
import { processRoutes } from './routes-processor.js'

const { routes } = await runner.import('virtual:ssr-routes')
processRoutes(routes)
```

Simple setups like in [SSR Guide](/guide/ssr) can still use `server.transformIndexHtml` directly if it's not expected that the server will run in a different process in production. However, if the server will run in an edge environment or a separate process, we recommend creating a virtual module to load HTML:

```ts {13-21}
function vitePluginVirtualIndexHtml(): Plugin {
  let server: ViteDevServer | undefined
  return {
    name: vitePluginVirtualIndexHtml.name,
    configureServer(server_) {
      server = server_
    },
    resolveId(source) {
      return source === 'virtual:index-html' ? '\0' + source : undefined
    },
    async load(id) {
      if (id === '\0' + 'virtual:index-html') {
        let html: string
        if (server) {
          this.addWatchFile('index.html')
          html = await fs.promises.readFile('index.html', 'utf-8')
          html = await server.transformIndexHtml('/', html)
        } else {
          html = await fs.promises.readFile('dist/client/index.html', 'utf-8')
        }
        return `export default ${JSON.stringify(html)}`
      }
      return
    },
  }
}
```

Then in SSR entry point you can call `import('virtual:index-html')` to retrieve the processed HTML:

```ts
import { render } from 'framework'

// this example uses cloudflare syntax
export default {
  async fetch() {
    // during dev, it will return transformed HTML
    // during build, it will bundle the basic index.html into a string
    const { default: html } = await import('virtual:index-html')
    return new Response(render(html), {
      headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },
    })
  },
}
```

This keeps the HTML processing server agnostic.

## Runtime agnostic SSR

:::info Running a module without relying on `RunnableDevEnvironment`

The initial proposal had a `run` method on the `DevEnvironment` class that would allow consumers to invoke an import on the runner side by using the `transport` option. During our testing we found out that the API was not universal enough to start recommending it. At the moment, we are looking for feedback on [the `FetchableDevEnvironment` proposal](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/discussions/18191).

:::

## Separate module graphs

Each environment has an isolated module graph. All module graphs have the same signature, so generic algorithms can be implemented to crawl or query the graph without depending on the environment. `hotUpdate` is a good example. When a file is modified, the module graph of each environment will be used to discover the affected modules and perform HMR for each environment independently.

::: info
Vite v5 had a mixed Client and SSR module graph. Given an unprocessed or invalidated node, it isn't possible to know if it corresponds to the Client, SSR, or both environments. Module nodes have some properties prefixed, like `clientImportedModules` and `ssrImportedModules` (and `importedModules` that returns the union of both). `importers` contains all importers from both the Client and SSR environment for each module node. A module node also has `transformResult` and `ssrTransformResult`. A backward compatibility layer allows the ecosystem to migrate from the deprecated `server.moduleGraph`.
:::

Each module is represented by a `EnvironmentModuleNode` instance. Modules may be registered in the graph without yet being processed (`transformResult` would be `null` in that case). `importers` and `importedModules` are also updated after the module is processed.

```ts
class EnvironmentModuleNode {
  environment: string

  url: string
  id: string | null = null
  file: string | null = null

  type: 'js' | 'css'

  importers = new Set<EnvironmentModuleNode>()
  importedModules = new Set<EnvironmentModuleNode>()
  importedBindings: Map<string, Set<string>> | null = null

  info?: ModuleInfo
  meta?: Record<string, any>
  transformResult: TransformResult | null = null

  acceptedHmrDeps = new Set<EnvironmentModuleNode>()
  acceptedHmrExports: Set<string> | null = null
  isSelfAccepting?: boolean
  lastHMRTimestamp = 0
  lastInvalidationTimestamp = 0
}
```

`environment.moduleGraph` is an instance of `EnvironmentModuleGraph`:

```ts
export class EnvironmentModuleGraph {
  environment: string

  urlToModuleMap = new Map<string, EnvironmentModuleNode>()
  idToModuleMap = new Map<string, EnvironmentModuleNode>()
  etagToModuleMap = new Map<string, EnvironmentModuleNode>()
  fileToModulesMap = new Map<string, Set<EnvironmentModuleNode>>()

  constructor(
    environment: string,
    resolveId: (url: string) => Promise<PartialResolvedId | null>,
  )

  async getModuleByUrl(
    rawUrl: string,
  ): Promise<EnvironmentModuleNode | undefined>

  getModulesByFile(file: string): Set<EnvironmentModuleNode> | undefined

  onFileChange(file: string): void

  invalidateModule(
    mod: EnvironmentModuleNode,
    seen: Set<EnvironmentModuleNode> = new Set(),
    timestamp: number = Date.now(),
    isHmr: boolean = false,
  ): void

  invalidateAll(): void

  async ensureEntryFromUrl(
    rawUrl: string,
    setIsSelfAccepting = true,
  ): Promise<EnvironmentModuleNode>

  createFileOnlyEntry(file: string): EnvironmentModuleNode

  async resolveUrl(url: string): Promise<ResolvedUrl>

  updateModuleTransformResult(
    mod: EnvironmentModuleNode,
    result: TransformResult | null,
  ): void

  getModuleByEtag(etag: string): EnvironmentModuleNode | undefined
}
```

## Environments during build

In the CLI, calling `vite build` and `vite build --ssr` will still build the client only and ssr only environments for backward compatibility.

When `builder.entireApp` is `true` (or when calling `vite build --app`), `vite build` will opt-in into building the entire app instead. This would later on become the default in a future major. A `ViteBuilder` instance will be created (build-time equivalent to a `ViteDevServer`) to build all configured environments for production. By default the build of environments is run in series respecting the order of the `environments` record. A framework or user can further configure how the environments are built using:

```js
export default {
  builder: {
    buildApp: async (builder) => {
      const environments = Object.values(builder.environments)
      return Promise.all(
        environments.map((environment) => builder.build(environment)),
      )
    },
  },
}
```

## Environment agnostic code

Most of the time, the current `environment` instance will be available as part of the context of the code being run so the need to access them through `server.environments` should be rare. For example, inside plugin hooks the environment is exposed as part of the `PluginContext`, so it can be accessed using `this.environment`. See [Environment API for Plugins](./api-environment-plugins.md) to learn about how to build environment aware plugins.
