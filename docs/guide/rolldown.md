# Rolldown Integration

Vite is planning to integrate [Rolldown](https://rolldown.rs), a Rust-powered JavaScript bundler, to improve build performance and capabilities.

## What is Rolldown?

Rolldown is a modern, high-performance JavaScript bundler written in Rust. It's designed as a drop-in replacement for Rollup, aiming to provide significant performance improvements while maintaining compatibility with the existing ecosystem.

Rolldown focuses on three key principles:

- **Speed**: Built with Rust for maximum performance
- **Compatibility**: Works with existing Rollup plugins
- **Optimization**: Comes with features that go beyond what esbuild and Rollup implement

## Why Vite is Migrating to Rolldown

1. **Unification**: Vite currently uses esbuild for dependency pre-bundling and Rollup for production builds. Rolldown aims to unify these into a single, high-performance bundler that can be used for both purposes, reducing complexity.

2. **Performance**: Rolldown's Rust-based implementation offers significant performance improvements over JavaScript-based bundlers. While specific benchmarks may vary by project size and complexity, early tests show promising speed increases compared to Rollup.

3. **Additional Features**: Rolldown introduces features that are not available in Rollup or esbuild, such as advanced chunk splitting control, built-in HMR, and Module Federation.

For additional insights on the motivations behind Rolldown, see the [reasons why Rolldown is being built](https://rolldown.rs/guide/#why-rolldown).

## Benefits of Trying `rolldown-vite`

- Experience significantly faster build times, especially for larger projects
- Provide valuable feedback to help shape the future of Vite's bundling experience
- Prepare your projects for the eventual official Rolldown integration

## How to Try Rolldown

The rolldown-powered version of Vite is currently available as a separate package called `rolldown-vite`. You can try it by adding package overrides to your `package.json`:

:::code-group

```json [npm]
{
  "overrides": {
    "vite": "npm:rolldown-vite@latest"
  }
}
```

```json [Yarn]
{
  "resolutions": {
    "vite": "npm:rolldown-vite@latest"
  }
}
```

```json [pnpm]
{
  "pnpm": {
    "overrides": {
      "vite": "npm:rolldown-vite@latest"
    }
  }
}
```

```json [Bun]
{
  "overrides": {
    "vite": "npm:rolldown-vite@latest"
  }
}
```

:::

After adding these overrides, reinstall your dependencies and start your development server or build your project as usual. No further configuration changes are required.

## Known Limitations

While Rolldown aims to be a drop-in replacement for Rollup, there are features that are still being implemented and minor intentional behavior differences. For a comprehensive list, please refer to [this GitHub PR](https://github.com/vitejs/rolldown-vite/pull/84#issue-2903144667) which is regularly updated.

### Option Validation Errors

Rolldown throws an error when unknown or invalid options are passed. Because some options available in Rollup are not supported by Rolldown, you may encounter errors based on the options you or the meta framework you use set. Below, you can find an an example of such an error message:

> Error: Failed validate input options.
>
> - For the "preserveEntrySignatures". Invalid key: Expected never but received "preserveEntrySignatures".

If you don't pass the option in yourself, this must be fixed by the utilized framework. You can suppress this error in the meantime by setting the `ROLLDOWN_OPTIONS_VALIDATION=loose` environment variable.

## Enabling Native Plugins

Thanks to Rolldown and Oxc, various internal Vite plugins, such as the alias or resolve plugin, have been converted to Rust. At the time of writing, using these plugins is not enabled by default, as their behavior may differ from the JavaScript versions.

To test them, you can set the `experimental.enableNativePlugin` option to `true` in your Vite config.

## Reporting Issues

Since this is an experimental integration, you may encounter issues. If you do, please report them in the [`vitejs/rolldown-vite`](https://github.com/vitejs/rolldown-vite) repository, **not the main Vite repository**.

When [reporting issues](https://github.com/vitejs/rolldown-vite/issues/new), please follow the appropriate issue template and provide what is requested there, commonly including:

- A minimal reproduction of the issue
- Your environment details (OS, Node version, package manager)
- Any relevant error messages or logs

For real-time discussions and troubleshooting, make sure to join the [Rolldown Discord](https://chat.rolldown.rs/).

## Future Plans

The `rolldown-vite` package is a temporary solution to gather feedback and stabilize the Rolldown integration. In the future, this functionality will be merged back into the main Vite repository.

We encourage you to try out `rolldown-vite` and contribute to its development through feedback and issue reports.

In the future, we will also introduce a "Full Bundle Mode" for Vite, which will serve bundled files in production _and development mode_.

### Why introducing a Full Bundle Mode?

Vite is known for its unbundled dev server approach, which is a main reason for Vite's speed and popularity when it was first introduced. This approach was initially an experiment to see just how far we could push the boundaries of development server performance without traditional bundling.

However, as projects scale in size and complexity, two main challenges have emerged:

1. **Development/Production inconsistency**: The unbundled JavaScript served in development versus the bundled production build creates different runtime behaviors. This can lead to issues that only manifest in production, making debugging more difficult.

2. **Performance degradation during development**: The unbundled approach results in each module being fetched separately, which creates a large number of network requests. While this has _no impact in production_, it causes significant overhead during dev server startup and when refreshing the page in development. The impact is especially noticeable in large applications where hundreds or even thousands of separate requests must be processed. These bottlenecks become even more severe when developers use network proxy, resulting in slower refresh times and degraded developer experience.

With the Rolldown integration, we have an opportunity to unify the development and production experiences while maintaining Vite's signature performance. A Full Bundle Mode would allow serving bundled files not only in production but also during development, combining the best of both worlds:

- Fast startup times even for large applications
- Consistent behavior between development and production
- Reduced network overhead on page refreshes
- Maintained efficient HMR on top of ESM output

When the Full Bundle Mode is introduced, it will be an opt-in feature at first. Similar to the Rolldown integration, we are aiming to make it the default after gathering feedback and ensuring stability.

## Plugin / Framework authors guide

::: tip
This section is mostly relevant for plugin and framework authors. If you are a user, you can skip this section.

### Overview of Major Changes

- Rolldown is used for build (Rollup was used before)
- Rolldown is used for the optimizer (esbuild was used before)
- CommonJS support is handled by Rolldown (@rollup/plugin-commonjs was used before)
- Oxc is used for syntax lowering (esbuild was used before)
- Lightning CSS is used for CSS minification by default (esbuild was used before)
- Oxc minifier is used for JS minification by default (esbuild was used before)
- Rolldown is used for bundling the config (esbuild was used before)

### Detecting `rolldown-vite`

::: warning
In most cases, you don't need to detect whether your plugin runs with `rolldown-vite` or `vite` and you should aim for consistent behavior across both, without conditional branching.
:::

In case you need different behavior with `rolldown-vite`, you have two ways to detect if `rolldown-vite` is used:

Checking the existence of `this.meta.rolldownVersion`:

```js
const plugin = {
  resolveId() {
    if (this.meta.rolldownVersion) {
      // logic for rolldown-vite
    } else {
      // logic for rollup-vite
    }
  },
}
```

<br>

Checking the existence of the `rolldownVersion` export:

```js
import * as vite from 'vite'

if (vite.rolldownVersion) {
  // logic for rolldown-vite
} else {
  // logic for rollup-vite
}
```

If you have `vite` as a dependency (not a peer dependency), the `rolldownVersion` export is useful as it can be used from anywhere in your code.

### Ignoring option validation in Rolldown

As [mentioned above](#option-validation-errors), Rolldown throws an error when unknown or invalid options are passed.

This can be fixed by conditionally passing the option by checking whether it's running with `rolldown-vite` as [shown above](#detecting-rolldown-vite).

Suppressing the error by setting the `ROLLDOWN_OPTIONS_VALIDATION=loose` environment variable also works in this case.
However, keep in mind that you will **eventually need to stop passing the options not supported by Rolldown**.

### `transformWithEsbuild` requires `esbuild` to be installed separately

A similar function called `transformWithOxc`, which uses Oxc instead of `esbuild`, is exported from `rolldown-vite`.

### Compatibility layer for `esbuild` options

Rolldown-Vite has a compatibility layer to convert options for `esbuild` to the respective Oxc or `rolldown` ones. As tested in [the ecosystem-ci](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-ecosystem-ci/blob/rolldown-vite/README-temp.md), this works in many cases, including simple `esbuild` plugins.
That said, **we'll be removing the `esbuild` options support in the future** and encourage you to try the corresponding Oxc or `rolldown` options.
You can get the options set by the compatibility layer from the `configResolved` hook.

```js
const plugin = {
  name: 'log-config',
  configResolved(config) {
    console.log('options', config.optimizeDeps, config.oxc)
  },
},
```

### Hook filter feature

Rolldown introduced a [hook filter feature](https://rolldown.rs/guide/plugin-development#plugin-hook-filters) to reduce the communication overhead the between Rust and JavaScript runtimes. By using this feature you can make your plugin more performant.
This is also supported by Rollup 4.38.0+ and Vite 6.3.0+. To make your plugin backward compatible with the older versions, make sure to also run the filter inside the hook handlers.

### Converting content to JavaScript in `load` or `transform` hooks

If you are converting the content to JavaScript from other types in `load` or `transform` hooks, you may need to add `moduleType: 'js'` to the returned value.

```js
const plugin = {
  name: 'txt-loader',
  load(id) {
    if (id.endsWith('.txt')) {
      const content = fs.readFile(id, 'utf-8')
      return {
        code: `export default ${JSON.stringify(content)}`,
        moduleType: 'js', // [!code ++]
      }
    }
  },
}
```

This is because [Rolldown supports non-JavaScript modules](https://rolldown.rs/guide/in-depth/module-types) and infers the module type from extensions unless specified. Note that `rolldown-vite` does not support ModuleTypes in dev.
