# Deploying a Static Site

The following guides are based on some shared assumptions:

- You are using the default build output location (`dist`). This location [can be changed using `build.outDir`](/config/build-options.md#build-outdir), and you can extrapolate instructions from these guides in that case.
- You are using npm. You can use equivalent commands to run the scripts if you are using Yarn or other package managers.
- Vite is installed as a local dev dependency in your project, and you have setup the following npm scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

It is important to note that `vite preview` is intended for previewing the build locally and not meant as a production server.

::: tip NOTE
These guides provide instructions for performing a static deployment of your Vite site. Vite also supports Server Side Rendering. SSR refers to front-end frameworks that support running the same application in Node.js, pre-rendering it to HTML, and finally hydrating it on the client. Check out the [SSR Guide](./ssr) to learn about this feature. On the other hand, if you are looking for integration with traditional server-side frameworks, check out the [Backend Integration guide](./backend-integration) instead.
:::

## Building the App

You may run `npm run build` command to build the app.

```bash
$ npm run build
```

By default, the build output will be placed at `dist`. You may deploy this `dist` folder to any of your preferred platforms.

### Testing the App Locally

Once you've built the app, you may test it locally by running `npm run preview` command.

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm run preview
```

The `vite preview` command will boot up a local static web server that serves the files from `dist` at `http://localhost:4173`. It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.

You may configure the port of the server by passing the `--port` flag as an argument.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "preview": "vite preview --port 8080"
  }
}
```

Now the `preview` command will launch the server at `http://localhost:8080`.

## GitHub Pages

1. Set the correct `base` in `vite.config.js`.

   If you are deploying to `https://<USERNAME>.github.io/`, you can omit `base` as it defaults to `'/'`.

   If you are deploying to `https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO>/`, for example your repository is at `https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO>`, then set `base` to `'/<REPO>/'`.

2. Go to your GitHub Pages configuration in the repository settings page and choose the source of deployment as "GitHub Actions", this will lead you to create a workflow that builds and deploys your project, a sample workflow that installs dependencies and builds using npm is provided:

   ```yml
   # Simple workflow for deploying static content to GitHub Pages
   name: Deploy static content to Pages

   on:
     # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
     push:
       branches: ['main']

     # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
     workflow_dispatch:

   # Sets the GITHUB_TOKEN permissions to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
   permissions:
     contents: read
     pages: write
     id-token: write

   # Allow one concurrent deployment
   concurrency:
     group: 'pages'
     cancel-in-progress: true

   jobs:
     # Single deploy job since we're just deploying
     deploy:
       environment:
         name: github-pages
         url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout
           uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - name: Set up Node
           uses: actions/setup-node@v3
           with:
             node-version: 18
             cache: 'npm'
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: npm install
         - name: Build
           run: npm run build
         - name: Setup Pages
           uses: actions/configure-pages@v3
         - name: Upload artifact
           uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1
           with:
             # Upload dist repository
             path: './dist'
         - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
           id: deployment
           uses: actions/deploy-pages@v1
   ```

## GitLab Pages and GitLab CI

1. Set the correct `base` in `vite.config.js`.

   If you are deploying to `https://<USERNAME or GROUP>.gitlab.io/`, you can omit `base` as it defaults to `'/'`.

   If you are deploying to `https://<USERNAME or GROUP>.gitlab.io/<REPO>/`, for example your repository is at `https://gitlab.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO>`, then set `base` to `'/<REPO>/'`.

2. Create a file called `.gitlab-ci.yml` in the root of your project with the content below. This will build and deploy your site whenever you make changes to your content:

   ```yaml
   image: node:16.5.0
   pages:
     stage: deploy
     cache:
       key:
         files:
           - package-lock.json
         prefix: npm
       paths:
         - node_modules/
     script:
       - npm install
       - npm run build
       - cp -a dist/. public/
     artifacts:
       paths:
         - public
     rules:
       - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
   ```

You can also deploy to a [custom domain](http://surge.sh/help/adding-a-custom-domain) by adding `surge dist yourdomain.com`.

## Azure Static Web Apps

You can quickly deploy your Vite app with Microsoft Azure [Static Web Apps](https://aka.ms/staticwebapps) service. You need:

- An Azure account and a subscription key. You can create a [free Azure account here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).
- Your app code pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com).
- The [SWA Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurestaticwebapps) in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

Install the extension in VS Code and navigate to your app root. Open the Static Web Apps extension, sign in to Azure, and click the '+' sign to create a new Static Web App. You will be prompted to designate which subscription key to use.

Follow the wizard started by the extension to give your app a name, choose a framework preset, and designate the app root (usually `/`) and built file location `/dist`. The wizard will run and will create a GitHub action in your repo in a `.github` folder.

The action will work to deploy your app (watch its progress in your repo's Actions tab) and, when successfully completed, you can view your app in the address provided in the extension's progress window by clicking the 'Browse Website' button that appears when the GitHub action has run.

## Render

You can deploy your Vite app as a Static Site on [Render](https://render.com/).

1. Create a [Render account](https://dashboard.render.com/register).

2. In the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/), click the **New** button and select **Static Site**.

3. Connect your GitHub/GitLab account or use a public repository.

4. Specify a project name and branch.

   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish Directory**: `dist`

5. Click **Create Static Site**.

   Your app should be deployed at `https://<PROJECTNAME>.onrender.com/`.

By default, any new commit pushed to the specified branch will automatically trigger a new deployment. [Auto-Deploy](https://render.com/docs/deploys#toggling-auto-deploy-for-a-service) can be configured in the project settings.

You can also add a [custom domain](https://render.com/docs/custom-domains) to your project.
