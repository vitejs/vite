/**
 * Plugins that use 'virtual modules' (e.g. for helper functions), prefix the
 * module ID with `\0`, a convention from the rollup ecosystem.
 * This prevents other plugins from trying to process the id (like node resolution),
 * and core features like sourcemaps can use this info to differentiate between
 * virtual modules and regular files.
 * `\0` is not a permitted char in import URLs so we have to replace them during
 * import analysis. The id will be decoded back before entering the plugins pipeline.
 * These encoded virtual ids are also prefixed by the VALID_ID_PREFIX, so virtual
 * modules in the browser end up encoded as `/@id/__x00__{id}`
