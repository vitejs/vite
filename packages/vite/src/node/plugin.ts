/**
 * Vite plugins extends the Rollup plugin interface with a few extra
 * vite-specific options. A valid vite plugin is also a valid Rollup plugin.
 * On the contrary, a Rollup plugin may or may NOT be a valid vite universal
 * plugin, since some Rollup features do not make sense in an unbundled
 * dev server context. That said, as long as a rollup plugin doesn't have strong
 * coupling between its bundle phase and output phase hooks then it should
 * just work (that means, most of them).
 *
 * By default, the plugins are run during both serve and build. When a plugin
 * is applied during serve, it will only run **non output plugin hooks** (see
 * rollup type definition of {@link rollup#PluginHooks}). You can think of the
 * dev server as only running `const bundle = rollup.rollup()` but never calling
 * `bundle.generate()`.
 *
 * A plugin that expects to have different behavior depending on serve/build can
 * export a factory function that receives the command being run via options.
 *
 * If a plugin should be applied only for server or build, a function format
 * config file can be used to conditional determine the plugins to use.
 *
 * The current environment can be accessed from the context for the all non-global
 * hooks (it is not available in config, configResolved, configureServer, etc).
 * It can be a dev, build, or scan environment.
 * Plugins can use this.environment.mode === 'dev' to guard for dev specific APIs.
